Computation of Reeb graphs
----------------------------
This folder contains the following files / folders:
1. javadoc folder
2. src folder 
3. build.xml
4. and this readme file

Requirements
------------
This program requires **Java 1.5** or higher
To compile this code using the given build.xml Apache Ant is required. (tested on Apache Ant 1.8.0)

Extending code to support other file formats
---------------------------------------------

1. You need to write a loader that extend the interface iisc.vgl.external.loader.MeshLoader
2. Add this loader source in the src/meshloader folder in the appropriate package
3. Run ant to compile and create a new meshloader.jar file in the build folder
4. replace this jar file in the executable folder.
5. Register this new loader by providing its name and class information in the loaders.xml file present in the executable folder.
6. You can now use this loader by providing its registered name in the input.properties file.

If you make changes to the Reebgraph computation code
-----------------------------------------------------
You can compile the complete code by using the command
ant buildAll

This will create both the reebgraph.jar and meshloader.jar file in the build folder.



See the javadoc for more details regarding the Loader interface.
